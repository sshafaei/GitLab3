# Git & GitHub Mini-Lab: `GitLab3`

## Purpose  
This repository is for a short hands-on class activity where you will:
- practice cloning a repo  
- create branches  
- commit changes  
- push to GitHub  
- open pull requests & merge  
- resolve a small merge conflict  
- revert a commit  
- inspect version history  

## Starter File  
There is a file `quotes.txt` with a few starter lines:<br>
Be curious.<br>
Keep commits small.<br>
Write helpful messages.<br>

Your task: add your own tip / line, create a branch, do a pull request, etc (see class instructions).

## Setup (One-Time – Before You Begin)  
1. If you haven’t already configured Git on your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"  
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-URL>  
   cd GitLab3
   
## Activity Steps
(You’ll follow a guided set of steps during class — commit your own tip, open PR, handle a conflict, do a revert, etc.)

## Submission / Collaboration
You’re added as a collaborator (or you’ll fork this repo, if that workflow is used).
Create branches named feature/your-name-add-tip, fix/your-name-line2, etc.
Push your branch, open a pull request, merge when approved.
Enjoy the process — not about being “right”, but about practising Git workflow.
